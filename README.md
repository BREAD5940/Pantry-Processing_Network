# Pantry: Processing Network (v0.0.0)
The processing network ingredient in team 5940's creations! It is currently under initial development, come back soon!

# Dependencies
- Logging (v0.0+)
 - Because Gradle does not currently support nested composite builds, you must either add something like `includeBuild '../Pantry-Logging/'` to the `settings.gradle` for the project you are actually building or `--include-build '../Pantry-Logging/'` to the end of a gradle command.
